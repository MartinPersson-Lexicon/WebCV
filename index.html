            A 20-week LIA / internship during the last semester of the education
            at Malmö Yrkeshögskola. The project was a PoC app for Android. The
            project developed an AI-driven voice-controlled receptionist /
            kiosk. The built-in camera of a larger Android tablet detects new
            visitors to the oﬃce and initiates a welcome conversation with the
            visitor. Through the voice conversation, the visitor is received and
            relevant information about the visitor is extracted and saved. The
            relevant employee is thereafter notified to meet their guest at the
            entrance. A visitor badge could be printed. Techniques included
            Android Studio, Android, Java, Google Dialogflow (chatbot), Google
            Mobile Vision (face detection and tracking), Microsoft Cognitive
            Services (face identification), Scrum, Git, GitFlow and Jira. The
            development team consisted of myself and another course participant.
            From Cybercom we had a professional Product Owner and a professional
            Scrum Master.
